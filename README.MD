# A gui for kdmapper written in .net to be used with my latest kdmapper github repo

Original creator of kdmapper https://github.com/z175

Improved by https://github.com/TheCruZ

Please note I've taken the code from TheCruz and updated it so that it doesn't allocate any memory in the BigPoolTable (in the gui select mdl option), if there is some code I could've written better please let me know since I'm always willing to improve. (this is only the gui part look for the kdmapper repo for the mapper)

I wrote this gui because some people were having problems passing the correct arguments to kdmapper, the gui also shows an example driver entry you can use.
